EmpID is artificially created as a mix of Last and PD
Grade belongs to Person
Position has a minimum and maximum possible grade that can be used to fill
 - Min and Max were not available during initial data acquisition.  Set to blank.  Will fill later.  Maybe.
"Reports to" is a feature of the position, not the person
 - We can modify the values to remove the PersonID
Org Code is the database key for the Operation Unit
Positions are assigned to an Org Code
Operation Unit is the only part of the Org Code we care about

- Position title
- PD# (Called the Master Record #)
- Pay plan
- Series
- Grade
